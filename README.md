## LineCoverage-library
Library for Line Coverage with single and multiple robots:  
`slc` stands for single robot line coverage  
`mlc` stands for multiple robot line coverage

The algorithms are described in the following papers. Please cite our publications when using the library.

> Approximation algorithms for the single robot line coverage problem.  
> Agarwal S and Akella S (2020)  
> In: Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics XIV. Oulu, Finland, pp. 534–550.

> Line coverage with multiple robots.  
> Agarwal S and Akella S (2020)  
> In: IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA). Paris, France, pp. 3248–3254.


## Installation
The library has been tested on Ubuntu and should work with any GNU/Linux system provided the following dependencies have been installed.
These packages are usually already installed.

`sudo apt-get install git build-essential cmake unzip`

The library uses `YAML-CPP` for parsing yaml configuration files:  
`sudo apt-get install libyaml-cpp-dev`

The library uses GLPK by default for solving ILP and LP. GLPK 5.0 has better performance than the older 4.x versions, and it can be downloaded from https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/. On Debain-based systems you can install GLPK  using the following command:  
`sudo apt-get install libglpk-dev` (will probably install an older GLPK 4.x)

The library requires `gnuplot` for plotting. On Debian based systems `gnuplot` can be installed using the following command:  
`sudo apt-get install gnuplot`

If you are on a server:  
`sudo apt-get install gnuplot-nox`

#### Installation of LineCoverage-library (lclibrary):

Create a new directory for our workspace where we will be cloning the repository and creating builds:
```bash
mkdir ~/coverage_ws && cd ~/coverage_ws
git clone https://github.com/UNCCharlotte-CS-Robotics/LineCoverage-library.git
cmake -S LineCoverage-library/ -B ./build/lclibrary -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/lclibrary
cmake --install build/lclibrary
```

You should be able to see the binary files `slc` and `mlc` in the install directory after this process.

#### Get the LineCoverage-dataset
```bash
cd  ~/coverage_ws  
git clone https://github.com/UNCCharlotte-CS-Robotics/LineCoverage-dataset.git
```

#### Run programs
```bash
cd ~/coverage_ws
./install/bin/mlc LineCoverage-library/config/default_config.yaml
```

Check the folder `LineCoverage-dataset/most_pop_50cities/paris/`. You should find the input data and the results.  
Make a copy of the file `LineCoverage-library/config/default_config.yaml` and change according to your preference.  

For details on usage see wiki: https://github.com/UNCCharlotte-CS-Robotics/LineCoverage-library/wiki/Usage

#### Install with Gurobi:
Obtain Gurobi from https://www.gurobi.com/  
License and installation instructions are available at https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/10.0/quickstart_linux/index.html. Gurobi provides free academic license.  

A helpful installation script is provided for convenient installation.  
Please set the installation directory in the script.  
`cd LineCoverage-library/external/gurobi_setup.sh`  
Change installation directory for `Gurobi` in the file `gurobi_setup.sh`  
`bash gurobi_setup.sh`  
`source ~/.bashrc`  
Activate Gurobi license

To install LineCoverage-library with Gurobi enabled, add the following flags to `cmake` flag in step 3:  
`-DLCLIBRARY_USE_GUROBI=ON`  
Execute installation steps 6 and 7.

#### Install with LKH and GLKH:

LKH and GLKH are very efficient solvers for the ATSP and the GTSP, respectively. The solvers for single robot line coverage problem (slc) can optionally use LKH and GLKH.  
Please visit the links below for information and terms of use:  
LKH: http://webhotel4.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/  
GLKH: http://webhotel4.ruc.dk/~keld/research/GLKH/  

`cd LineCoverage-library/external`  
For LKH:  
`bash lkh_glkh_setup.sh -alkh`
For GLKH:  
`bash lkh_glkh_setup.sh -alkh -aglkh` (needs LKH)

`cd ~/coverage_ws`  
To install LineCoverage-library with LKH and GLKH support, add the following flags to `cmake` command in step 3.
For LKH:  
`-DLCLIBRARY_USE_LKH=ON`  
For GLKH:  
`-DLCLIBRARY_USE_LKH=ON -DLCLIBRARY_USE_GLKH=ON`  
Execute installation steps 4 and 5.

Folders `glkh` and `lkh` inside `LineCoverage-library/external` can be removed. You may also delete the `build` folder.

Note: LKH and GLKH are not part of this library. The programs makes system calls to the binaries.
In your `~/.bashrc` file add the following line so the GLKH can find the executables (required for only GLKH).  
`export PATH="${PATH}:${HOME}/coverage_ws/install/bin/glkh"`  
`source ~/.bashrc`

#### Python wrappers (work in progress)
A minimal script for creating and importing python wrappers has been provided in the directory `LineCoverage-library/python`. The python wrapper modules can be installed using the following commands:  

Install python libraries:  
`sudo apt-get install libpython3-dev`

Install boost libraries:  
`sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-python-dev libboost-numpy-dev`

```bash
cd ~/coverage_ws
cmake -S LineCoverage-library/python -B build/py_lclibrary -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/py_lclibrary 
cmake --install build/py_lclibrary
python3 ./install/bin/rpp_3by2.py
 ```
We are working on creating more python wrappers for the library.

## Contact
Users are requested to raise bugs to help improve the library. We are working on improving the documentation. Please use the GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions.  
The program is authored by Saurav Agarwal during his PhD (advised by Srinivas Akella) at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
